This is a very basic widget that adds a button to "pin" the current page to Pinterest.

There is only one image, which is hard-coded into the button

Maybe I will make a Drupal module with it when I have time, with better settings

You can see the button installed at http://faiththedog.info/ and http://netsperience.org/

More Pinterest goodies (and some original code which I adapted for the button) at http://pinterest.com/about/goodies/
